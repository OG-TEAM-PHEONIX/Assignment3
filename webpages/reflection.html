        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          The idea of Parents Pantry was what went the best with this project. The initial idea of Parents Pantry was strong but lacked nuance. 
          When Team Phoenix was formed the collaborative effort of everyone was able to provided the required technical skills and knowledge. 
          From there a sound project idea, aim and vision was created. This carried onto A3 and allowed for all members to understand what it was that we were doing and what 
          needed to be created. This foundation was our greatest strength. Unfortunately over the weeks there were various changes to the group. 
          A3 began with 3 active members and 2 new additions to the group. Throughout the project for unknown reasons 3 members of the group became unresponsive.
          This left the remaining work to be done between Will and JD who also had personal issues arise meaning less time was able to be spent on the project. 
          This unfortunately resulted in having to scale back the project and meant that JD and WIll did not have an opportunity to upskill in other areas which was something 
          that was planned for this project. Wills technical knowledge meant he became responsible for creating a significant amount of artefacts in comparison to JD resulting in 
          an unfair workload. The main lesson learnt surrounding group work is to better utilise team members when they are actually active. If this had been done better at the 
          start the process may have flowed easier. 

        </p>
        <h2>Personal Insights</h2>
        <q>
          When reflecting on the work that was completed during A3 I believe what I contributed was not up to the standards that it should have been, and my participation was 
          lacking at times which resulted in unfair stress to other team members. Unfortunately, during the project I had 7-10 days where I was not able to participate due to 
          sickness and other events outside of my control. The events were known to me, and I should have taken a greater initiative at the beginning of the project to get a 
          larger portion of work done. I had planned to have a greater technical involvement on this project, due to other members becoming unresponsive the workload was like 
          A2 where my skills were mostly used to complete research, writing and admin tasks. While I am happy with the work that has been achieved, 
          I believe I wasted an opportunity to learn more and build a greater skill set for future assignments. Communication and expectations once again impacted our ability to work. 
          In future group projects I will plan a greater buffer for unforeseen circumstances.  
        </q>

        <q>
          I feel my commitment to the completion of the project is evident throughout the entirety of the project report, the web design and 
          the creation of artefacts, and I remain confident in my contribution to the assignment being meaningful and mostly consistent. 
          I am happy with what I feel to be an increased initiative following A2 and I often felt as if I had a clearer idea of how to help 
          the team and what I wanted to say. A downfall I had was not always being able to communicate these ideas through, not committing to a 
          larger workload initially and falling sick during a period of development where my contact and progress were lacking. Through this assignment, 
          I came to terms with the harsh reality that people can easily say what they intend to do and what they will do, yet not be able to do it for various 
          reasons and circumstances. Whilst everyone deserves a degree of leeway, a bare minimum was expected that was not met by all members, despite efforts 
          in encouraging so. This was especially surprising for me coming off of both the A2 group reflection and A2 feedback with praise-worthy results.
