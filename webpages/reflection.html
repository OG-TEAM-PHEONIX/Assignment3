        <h1>Reflections (Yet to change from A2)</h1>
        <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            As a group Team Phoenix faced some challenges from the start. The group was put together by a auto allocation and unfortunately some members 
            of the group never participated or responded to any contact. Despite the initial setback the remaining four members of Team Phoenix worked well together. 
            At the beginning of the assignment each member discussed their personality types and learnings from Assignment 1. This aided the group in understanding one another better. 
            An area of improvement and a focus for Team Phoenix in assignment 3 will be transparency and better communication with one another. 
            When members were present and actively working together communication was strong, but there would often be days with no contact which resulted in certain 
            members having to do a significantly higher workload.
            <br><br>
            Another focus for assignment 3 will be upskilling. Each member in the group has varied skillsets and it will be a wasted opportunity and 
            learning experience if the group does not focus more on helping one another and working on tasks in a more collaborative nature. One reason this 
            was not done well in Assignment 2 was due to poor time management. Another thing that was learnt as a group is how important it is to let people play to their 
            strengths, especially in times of pressure. For example, William took it upon himself to start the group website and to work on the repository. This initiative 
            was vital in completing the assignment. Overall, everyone in Team Phoenix has agreed that this assignment is a learning experience, and we will take everything 
            we have learnt over the past 3 weeks to work better together for our final submission.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Insights</h2>
        <p>
            I am happy with my overall work in this assignment. Going into the group I knew my technical skills and knowledge would be lacking 
            and I was worried that this would set the group back as a whole. I do not believe this was the case at all. 
            My overall organisation, eye for detail and other general skills were a strength in our group dynamics and I believe they were critical to Team Phoenix as a whole. 
            One thing I learnt was how important a decision maker would be. In a professional setting a project lead is an important asset 
            and I believe that going into assignment 3 having someone take that position from the beginning will be vital. 
            While I do wish the work that we completed was more collaborative, a strength of our group and something that took me by surprise was how well everyone got along.

            I am pleased with the work that was completed for the Assignment, going into the group with minimal interaction we have prior to being allocated in the group, 
            it was nerve-racking, however with the first meeting I was quite excited to get to know them better and learn from all the members of the group. 
            I got to learn a lot from my teammates, and it was very organised. We were able to play to our strengths and active participation 
            ensured that we would get the work done effectively. The positive part for me was how well we all got along and the participation we were able 
            to have in our team meetings, but the area I feel like I can improve is on communicating my progress on my assignment and the timeframes that were 
            given in the task. I realised having a project timeline and setting realistic expectations would have been beneficial for the team. 
            However, we pushed through together as a team and managed to complete it in time. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-right mr-5 pr-5"> - Hasnain</p>
        <p>
            I am confident that I completed my work in a timely manner to a reasonable standard, with evident involvement within the group. Despite initial doubts, 
            I feel my contribution in a technical, creative and knowledge sense was valuable and helped progression with the assignment. However, an area I believe 
            I could improve in is acting sooner rather than later, to define clarity, gauge progress and advance outstanding tasks. 
            I feel I could have better communicated my own progress and workload better to the team as well. Surprisingly, actively participating and 
            getting involved with the group, especially during meetings, was easier than first thought, since members were relatively easy to get along with. 
            One thing I realized was how important it would be to establish roles and workloads at the beginning of a project. 
            Delegating roles within the first meeting or two would have maximized efficiency and ensured each member would be able to play to their strengths.
