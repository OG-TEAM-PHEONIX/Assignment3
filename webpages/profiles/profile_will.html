              William is a student at RMIT through Open Universities currently studying Introduction to IT as a part of Team Phoenix and Introduction to Programming. 
              Born and raised in North-West Tasmania, Will was lucky enough to experience other cultures through his multicultural family: 
              his mother, Filipino, and his father, British and German. His favorite pastimes include volleyball, gaming and watching an abhorrent number of films and shows. 
              His interest in IT began at a young age, where technology always seemed like a case of ‘out with the old, 
              in with the new’ so with his spare time he’d enjoy taking apart old phones or laptops, to look inside and try to understand how those devices ran. 
              Video games also play a big part in his interest. Will has previously completed a certificate IV in Web Design through TasTafe Online but otherwise has no experience yet. <br><br>

      <h4> Career Plan </h4>
      <p>
        I would like to explore as many options as I can to facilitate any potential opportunities that may welcome different options later, should I ever change my mind. 
        Having already completed a Certificate IV in web design through TasTafe and now being enrolled into a Bachelor of IT via OUA, I have already begun my endeavor. 
        Completing the bachelor's degree is my singular goal for now, which should provide a solid basis to begin a career in the industry. 
        To advance towards the ideal job, undertaking electives in Cloud Computing, Data Communication and Net-Centric Computing, and UNIX Systems Administration and Programming (Linux). 
        Yet, pursuing more programming intensive courses appears appealing for a more software-based interest. After graduating, I will be looking at internships and entry-level 
        positions on the mainland in either software engineering or network engineering. For the former, it might also be necessary to develop a portfolio displaying acquired skills 
        and experience with side projects, workshops and hackathons. If I am to proceed with the latter, I will also be looking at obtaining a CCNA and CCNP certification, which requires 
        taking part in a training course and completing exams. I would also like to continue training myself and developing skills in programming and web coding with personal projects 
        that may proceed towards building a portfolio.
