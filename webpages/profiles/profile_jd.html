                  Advocates seek fulfillment but will not do so at the expense of others. 
                  This personality type is a conscientious hard worker that can be prone to burnout and perfectionism.

          <h4> Career Plan </h4>
          <p>
            JD is currently studying a bachelor of IT through OUA in a part time capacity. In 2024 JD plans to increase her studies to full time and begin an IT development 
            plan at her current employer. The IT development plan is available to employees who meet certain criteria regarding length of service and diversity requirements. 
            Completing this development plan in conjunction with her university studies will directly improve JD’s chances at being accepted in The 
            Groups Graduate program which JD plans to apply for at the end of 2024. JD then plans to complete a graduate program within the financial services industry which 
            includes a rotation throughout different departments. Depending on the workload JD will aim to complete her master's in data science. 
            If this is not possible JD will apply for long service leave from her current employer to complete her masters and upon completion JD plans to apply for a job with ASIC.
