    <h1>Skills and Jobs</h1>
      <p>
        When presented with the opportunity to hire 4 people for the growth of PP it was important to take into consideration the current skillset of 
        Team Phoenix and the developmental needs of the project. This involved referring to the project timeline, the plans and progress and the scope. The 4 jobs to be advertised are:
        <ul>
          <li>Cloud Engineer</li>
          <li>Database developer</li>
          <li>Full stack developer</li>
          <li>Software engineer - Android</li>
        </ul>
        The fulfillment of each of these roles would result in a minimum viable product being reached in an expedited timeframe. 
        To establish what skills would be required various job roles were researched with the most common roles and responsibilities 
        collated and personalised to suit the needs of Parents Pantry. Given the similarity between Parents Pantry and the previously mentioned 
        Diffords cocktail an initial search was done for jobs at Diffords, this unfortunately returned no results so mobile app employment was then researched.
