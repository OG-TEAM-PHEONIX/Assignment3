          On a surface level the app is simple. There will be a large data set that is filtered and presented to the user. The key to an app like this being successful will be making the app user friendly and visually appealing and to have a data source that is always growing with additional activities being added on a frequent basis.
          <br><br>
          Databases will be storing a user’s log-in details such as their username or email and password. Their own personal details as well as their children’s will need to be entered and stored, such as name, age, number of children and so on. Additional databases will be added to hold inventory items related to a specific user, containing user-inputted information such as materials and pantry items.
          <br><br>
          To store user information and host the mobile application itself, a remote server will ideally be required in some form. A PaaS-based hosting platform will be the best for the scope of this mobile app, as it reduces coding time and allows for easy, focused mobile development. This means the host will also be handling the physical servers, storage, operating systems, networking firewalls and security. An example of a potential PaaS hosting service is Microsoft Azure.
          <br><br>
          The local internal storage of the device will also be taken into consideration to handle temporary information and will be purged or reset each time the user logs out of the app. This will likely relate to user-inputted searches and filters, such as environmental factors.
          <br><br>
          The core of the app will depend on the software algorithm that takes the aforementioned factors and creates suggestions for the user based on them. This will essentially be a user-initiated search with applied filters from both user account data and user-input data. The search will scan another database that contains suggestions with related filter keys. This part will require an algorithm coded with a language that can talk to databases, such as Python or SQL. 
          <br><br>
          Creating wireframes and mock-ups will be necessary to facilitate the development of the app, and Adobe XD is an available service that excels in this department, however, there are cheaper alternatives out there. Adobe XD can further be used for the prototyping stage of development, but Proto.io is another useful alternative. The actual User Interface and creation of the app will be a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For a more streamlined and efficient development, React Native is a popular JavaScript Framework for mobile development. A clean and simple user interface will be important as the aim of the app is to help parents spend less time searching on their phones. To optimise the User Experience, user testing will be crucial to implementing an intuitive and easy-to-use UX. Feedback from testers throughout the entire development cycle will be necessary to ensure the app is built to a publication standard.

          To ensure that our app is developed to a highly functional standard, testing will commence as soon as the minimal viable product is achieved. This will range from initial feasibility studies to advanced beta testing to allow for feedback that can provide guidance with the late stages of development, giving insight to what final tweaks need be made to the final design. This phase of testing also helps iron out any bugs that would be easy to fix during the earlier stages, rather than during the launch of the finished product. Deploying frequent testing throughout the development cycle will also ensure that any patch fixes won’t also create new bugs while trying to fix old ones.   
          <br><br>
          Our first release will see that a limited number of volunteers will be able to test the app before submitting a questionnaire – a combination of testers from our target audience and with experienced testers would be ideal for invaluable feedback. These people can be found online - one way to attract interest is via a dedicated landing page, where individuals may be able to register, download and provide feedback. Sending emails to such users in a redundant fashion will aid in keeping their engagement also. From here, we may also gather potential testers simply from friends and family, and by extension, their friends and family or from already well-established beta tester communities such as Reddit or UserTesting. Budget permitting, a targeted advertising campaign may also generate traffic for testers and even the potential user base. With future prospects considering expanding our current development team, the scale of our project can be considered small, which would require a minimum of 10-15 beta testers, and an additional tenfold for if we saw considerable growth (Rachlin, 2022). Of course, this number can vary depending on what part exactly we are testing.
          <br><br>
          Testing would have to be sectioned into trials for different aspects of the app, breaking up the process into discrete tasks so that testing teams can provide specific and targeted insight. For example, a limited assessment for the graphics rendering of the interface, or a trial that focuses on the database logic and optimization. These can be categorised into beta testing, software testing, usability, functional and performance testing, just to name a few, or for other aspects which test security, design and compatibility. Recognizing which areas we want tested at the time will determine what sort of feedback we wish to receive, which in turn also controls how many and what sort of testers we want. “Depending on what your app is, you will only benefit if you are associating with the relevant beta testers” (Rachlin, 2016). Seeing as the Parents Pantry is directed for parents, we should seek out particular people that are partnered or single parents, child carers, nannies and babysitters of all ages, rather than young couples or truck drivers, for example.
          <br><br>
          To determine how successful these tests would be and effectively measure our success, certain metrics would need to be ascertained. This would provide answers to questions such as are these tests cost-effective to perform, do they contribute to the goals and milestones of the team, are they useful in debugging and are they comprehensive enough to expedite a final product? Throughout each phase of testing, such aforementioned questions would need to be weighed to justify current systems of testing or necessitate the change of them.
