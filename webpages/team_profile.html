    <h2>
        Meet The Team
    </h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
      Continuing from A2 Team Phoenix had some minor changes to group dynamics. The active members of the group for the purpose of the project will be included below.
      Each member of team phoenix created a personal profile in A2, that information was carried through to A3. As each member had worked with one another already 
      there was a sound understanding of one another's working styles and strengths and weaknesses.
      <br><br>
      <b>Group Processes</b> <br>
      During A2 Team Phoenix were able to identify several strengths and opportunities. One of the greatest strengths was that each member wanted to continue with Parents Pantry for 
      the project idea which resulted in a lot of creativity, ideas and eagerness to move on with the project. The goal is to achieve a minimum viable project with plans to continue 
      forward with this beyond the assignment completion. Understanding one another's working styles and personality types also aided Team Phoenix in our structure and conflict resolution. 
      For A3 the main priority is to set clear expectations and communication guidelines.
